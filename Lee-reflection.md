What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
The concept I was struggling with before the GPS session was the pull and push results if multiple people were working on the same project.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The above conflict was clarified during the GPS sessions. Also the reiteration of the concepts of using Git and GitHub was done when working with will.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked the concept about question one above to our guide\(peter\).
The questions I had asked Will was more about the procedures and understandings of the GPS 1 assignment. Also had more discussions with Git itself with Will.

What still confuses you about Git?
After doing the GPS or even just the pairing session with Will, it helped me get more practice with using Git/GitHub and I think I know the concepts pretty well now inside and out. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Since this was my first experience while doing a pairing in a GPS session, I was nervous and didn't expect that much. After doing this session, I loved that DBC has this in the curriculum because it helped me a lot with my current understanding of what we worked on and what I needed to improve or retouch on. 
Having another classmate doing this assignment helped me see another perspective on the understanding of the material that I would not have seen just by doing this myself. I learned that I need to form a better technique of explaining things, because I tend to ramble and it might put the other person more confused with my explanation.
